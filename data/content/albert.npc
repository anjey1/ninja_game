-The raiders have breached the outer town, Albert.
Yes, my prince, and they are advancing towards the castle as we speak. How many do you estimate?
-Too many for comfort, but not enough to conquer if we act swiftly. What are our defenses looking like?
The gates are sturdy, but the men are weary and supplies are thin. We cannot let them reach the throne room.
-Agreed, but we’ll need a strategy. Direct combat may be unwise. What do you suggest, Albert?
A diversion, my prince. Draw them into the narrow corridors. You mean to bottleneck them?
-Precisely. Fewer numbers mean their strength is diminished. And the townspeople?
They’ve been sheltered in the lower chambers. For now, they’re safe.
-What if they breach the gates?
Then we fight to the last man. But let us hope it doesn’t come to that.
-You’re a brave man, Albert.
And you’re a brave prince. Shall we prepare the men?
-Yes, sound the horns. The castle will not fall tonight.
As you command, my prince.
